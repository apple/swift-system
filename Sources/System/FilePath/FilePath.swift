/// Represents a location in the file system.
///
/// This structure recognizes directory separators  (e.g. `/`), roots, and
/// requires that the content terminates in a NUL (`0x0`). Beyond that, it
/// does not give any meaning to the bytes that it contains. The file system
/// defines how the content is interpreted; for example, by its choice of string
/// encoding.
///
/// On construction, `FilePath` will normalize separators by removing
/// redundant intermediary separators and stripping any trailing separators.
/// On Windows, `FilePath` will also normalize forward slashes `/` into
/// backslashes `\`, as preferred by the platform.
///
/// The code below creates a file path from a string literal,
/// and then uses it to open and append to a log file:
///
///     let message: String = "This is a log message."
///     let path: FilePath = "/tmp/log"
///     let fd = try FileDescriptor.open(path, .writeOnly, options: .append)
///     try fd.closeAfter { try fd.writeAll(message.utf8) }
///
/// File paths conform to the
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/swift/equatable>
/// and <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/swift/hashable> protocols
/// by performing the protocols' operations on their raw byte contents.
/// This conformance allows file paths to be used,
/// for example, as keys in a dictionary.
/// However, the rules for path equivalence
/// are file-systemâ€“specific and have additional considerations
/// like case insensitivity, Unicode normalization, and symbolic links.
